        const poem = `Taylor Swift gave me an idea about The 1.
She made me look forward to meeting that specific person I've always prayed to God for.
Time and again I thought I've found her, but time and again I get proved wrong and I falter.
I shake it off and tell myself, eventually I'll meet her.
So I kept myself busy and didn't worry about the thought.
I drew, I went out, stayed in, upskilled, basically what a nerd does so I don't think much about you.
It took a long time and I told myself, maybe I am not lucky enough like others to meet their The 1, not even in my Wildest Dreams. 
But then a friend of mine told me to try dating, and that's when I met YOU. 

We talked and got to know each other, and that's how the story of us came to be.
Right from the get go, I knew You Belong with me. 
Right from the get go, seeing Daylight made me feel so free, free because there wasn't any sign of toxicity.
Right from the get go, I saw how reassuring you are and how you love me like how I love you.
Now, every night we talk and now we know each other better, it makes me think that I can't believe now I do have a Lover. 
Not just a simple lover, but someone who loves me like how I love her. 
A month of loving and to eternity we shall be beside each other.
Here's to more "just because" surprises and genuine milestone celebrations of our love.
And that's how Taylor Swift helped me appreciate you being my The 1`;
